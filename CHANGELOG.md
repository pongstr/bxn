## [1.1.0-RC2] - Truth of a Madman
### OS X 10.11 Support
**Latest Updates**

- Removed: `puppet-{app_name}`, apps that don't need env settings are now
  installed via Package class, sources depends on where it's available.
- Removed: `boot2docker`, as per vendor notice, it's deprecated and is
  replaced with `Docker-Machine` brewcask provider.
- Updated: Redis `v3.0.4`
- Updated: Node.js `v4.1.1`
- Patched: [#30](https://github.com/toro-io/bxn/issues/30) [#32](https://github.com/toro-io/bxn/issues/32)

**Known issues**

  - `Docker-Machine` installation fails due to the "need of `sudo`" for
    specific casks, a "hacky way" to work around it is to run:
    `while true; do sudo ls -l; sleep 2; done;` before installation begins
    so it keeps sudo session alive and succeed the cask's installation.
