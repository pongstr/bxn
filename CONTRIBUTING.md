Contributing Guidelines
---

#### [Github Workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

- This repository complies 100% to Github workflow. No excuses, No Bullshit.

#### Coding Style

- We've setup the `.editorconfig`, if your editor doesn't support it you can
  let your brain to parse it which is extremely hard (you can do it! but the
  output might not be accurate in some cases). This will keep our diffs as
  clean as possible and easier to read.
- We're no Puppet or Ruby pros but the main idea is to write your code as
  readable as possible, we want things done here the right, better way properly
  and well thought of, "getting it done" or "it's working anyway" is not
  enough for us to merge your changes, think back and review then create a PR.
- Basically, give effort to your commits and don't fuck shit up for everyone
  and everything will be alright.

#### Application Requests

This is the super easy part, no need to write `puppet` anymore. So as long as
the apps you are requesting are **SysAd** approved apps, all you need to this
is add `hiera/users/your_personal_stuff.yaml`, provided the apps are available
via Homebrew (native osx apps or homebrew packages) you can easily add them
straight up like so:

```yaml
boxen::personal::homebrew_packages:
  - heroku-toolbelt

boxen::personal::osx_apps:
  - appcleaner
  - deluge
  - github-desktop
  - skype
  - spotify

boxen::personal::projects:
  - tomorrowland
  - darkstar
```
