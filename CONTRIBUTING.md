#### [Github Workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

- This repository complies 100% to Github workflow. No excuses, No Bullshit.

#### Coding Style

- We've setup the `.editorconfig`, if your editor doesn't support it you can
  use your brain to parse it. This will keep our diffs as clean as possible and
  easier to read.
- We're no Puppet or Ruby pros but the main idea is to write your code as
  readable as possible, we want things done here the right, better way properly
  and well thought of, "getting it done" or "it's working anyway" is not
  enough for us to merge your changes, think back and review then create a PR.
- Basically, give effort to your commits and don't fuck shit up for everyone
  and everything will be alright.
